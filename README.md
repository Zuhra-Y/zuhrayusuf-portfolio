# Zuhra Yusuf Portfolio

## Description

I built this Portfolio Project to facilitate anyone to be able to observe some of the skills that I have learnt so far on the EdX Front End Devloper Bootcamp. The intent is to showcase some skills but also a way to tell you about myself, some of my work and ways to contact me. 

I was able to utilise not only my HTML knowledge I have accumulated, but also CSS - in particular styling the HTML using the Flexbox model which is a favourite of mine so far. I can appreciate thee Grid model but have fallen for Flexbox. 
Which do you prefer?

In creating this portfolio project, I learnt how to use and the importance of being precise in using GitHub. I think I have become comfortable using GitHub for Version Control and also committing work, but I am still yet to commit often, however little. Considering where I started with my first repository, I have come some way and I am proud! I still am having hiccups with media queries, possibly due to using Flexbox and not grid, but I plan to work on this and ask for help to further understand this and utilise it in the future.

In creating this Portfolio, I'd love to add more notes in the respective sections and especially work to showcase in the future as I build my skills na dprojects. I would like to be more creative as I spent more time on the logistics of setting the page up as best as possible but with time, it'll be exciting to see what I can achieve in a few more months.
